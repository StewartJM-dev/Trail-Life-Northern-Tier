## üìß EMAIL FOR FRANK (Updated)

**2. Troop Information**
For other troops in the region (I have PA-1997 and NY-2911):
- Troop number and location

- Troop website links (if available)

**3. Contact Information**
- Primary email for regional inquiries

**Note:** The calendar integration is already set up and pulling events from Trail Life Connect automatically! And I've added a complete fundraising section with proven vendors and official guidelines.

Walk Worthy!
