# üí∞ Trail Life Northern Tier - Fundraising Guide

## The #1 Reason Troops Fail

**Most families that drop out do so because their Troop failed to "keep the promise" of providing a program full of trips and outdoor experiences.**

When we ask why families leave, the biggest reason is: **"We didn't do what we expected."**

Usually that's because of limited resources. Don't let that be your story!

## The Solution: Strategic Fundraising

### The Wrong Approaches ‚ùå

1. **Charging huge fees** - $300+ joining fees or constant dues that nickle-and-dime families
2. **Constant small fundraisers** - Car washes and bake sales every other weekend
3. **Individual family burden** - Each family pays for everything themselves

### The Right Approach ‚úÖ

**ONE major fundraiser** that covers most or all of your annual program costs
- **4-5 dedicated days** over a few weeks
- **Work as a team** - everyone contributes together
- **Result:** Fully-funded program for the entire year!

## Step 1: Program Planning (Do This First!)

### Annual Planning Session

**When:** Summer (or as early as May), BEFORE fall program starts
**Who:** Parents, leaders, and Trailmen - all stakeholders
**Goal:** Create a full calendar that everyone buys into

### The Process:

1. **Brainstorm Activities** (Month by Month)
   - What does everyone want to do this year?
   - No bad ideas - think BIG!
   - Write everything on a flip chart
   - Start with August/September, go through the full year

2. **Add Required Items**
   - Re-charter fees
   - Annual program fees
   - Leader training
   - Uniforms and advancements
   - Handbooks and standards
   - Troop equipment

3. **Calculate Costs**
   - Send boys outside for an activity
   - Keep parents and leaders in the room
   - Attach costs to each activity
   - Example: 20 Navigators at Summer Adventure ($200 each) = $4,000
   - **TOTAL IT UP** - The crowd will be shocked!

**Typical Annual Program Costs: $7,500 - $15,000+**

## Step 2: Budgeting & Fundraising Strategy

Now you know:
- ‚úÖ What you want to do (full program calendar)
- ‚úÖ What it will cost (realistic budget)
- ‚úÖ How to pay for it (ONE major fundraiser)

### Key Principle:
**Help parents see fundraising as a means for keeping the promise of fun and adventure!**

When families understand the WHY and feel part of the planning, they'll support the fundraising efforts.
